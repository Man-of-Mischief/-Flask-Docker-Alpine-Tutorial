# Building a Flask Application Inside a Docker Container with Alpine Linux

I recently wrote an article on Medium where I shared a step-by-step guide on building a Flask application inside a Docker container with Alpine Linux. ðŸš€

In this tutorial, I cover the entire process of setting up a Flask application, containerizing it using Docker, and leveraging the lightweight Alpine Linux as the base image. 

The article covers the following topics:
- Writing a Flask application
- Creating a Dockerfile for containerization
- Installing dependencies and running the application
- Understanding the role of Alpine Linux in containerizing Flask apps

If you're a beginner looking to get started with Flask or a DevOps enthusiast interested in containerization, this tutorial is for you. Dive in and learn how to build and deploy Flask applications with ease!
